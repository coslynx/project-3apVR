# Discord Bot Project

## Project Description
Develop a Discord bot that allows users to look up lesbian pornography content within the Discord server. The bot will be created using the discord.js library and a .js file for easy deployment and management. Users can interact with the bot through commands to search for specific lesbian pornographic content. The bot will provide relevant search results based on user input and preferences. Users can access and view the search results directly within the Discord server.

## Features
- User-friendly Commands:
  - Implement easy-to-use commands for users to search for lesbian pornography content.
  - Include commands for searching by category, keywords, or specific performers.
  
- Search Functionality:
  - Enable the bot to search through a database or external source for relevant lesbian pornographic content.
  - Provide accurate and up-to-date search results for users.
  
- Content Display:
  - Display search results within the Discord server in a clear and organized manner.
  - Include options for users to view more details or access external links for the content.
  
- Filtering Options:
  - Incorporate filtering options for users to refine their search results based on preferences such as duration, quality, or popularity.
  - Allow users to customize their search criteria for a more personalized experience.

## Enhancements
- Implement a rating system for users to provide feedback on the search results.
- Include the ability for users to save their favorite content or create playlists within the bot.
- Integrate a feature for users to request specific content or suggest improvements for the bot.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Languages:
  - Node.js for developing the Discord bot.
  - JavaScript for coding the bot's functionality.
